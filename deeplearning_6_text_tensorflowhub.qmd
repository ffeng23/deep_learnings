## Aims:

+ try to run text classification using models pretrained in tensorflow-hub.

In this case, tensorflow-hub is "TensorFlow Hub is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning and deployable anywhere. Reuse trained models like BERT and Faster R-CNN with just a few lines of code. ". 

See the guide in https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/overview

## Example

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification_with_hub

```{python install}
#| eval: false 
#!pip install tensorflow-hub
#!pip install tensorflow-datasets

# or
#!uv add tensorflow-hub tensorflow-datasets

```

Now download data

```{python loadlibrary}

import os
import numpy as np

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

print("Version: ", tf.__version__)
print("Eager mode: ", tf.executing_eagerly())
print("Hub version: ", hub.__version__)
print("GPU is", "available" if tf.config.list_physical_devices("GPU") else "NOT AVAILABLE")

```

download data

```{python data}

# Split the training set into 60% and 40% to end up with 15,000 examples
# for training, 10,000 examples for validation and 25,000 examples for testing.
train_data, validation_data, test_data = tfds.load(
    name="imdb_reviews", 
    split=('train[:60%]', 'train[60%:]', 'test'),
    as_supervised=True)

#builder = tfds.builder('imdb_reviews', data_dir='/config/deep_learnings/temp')
#builder.download_and_prepare()  # Manually trigger download and preparation
#    dataset = builder.as_dataset()

```
